playing with neural network from Shiffman                   THANK YOU SHIFFMAN

It just ride the scooter for you xd

This is my first NN rewritten from Shiffman cause I don't have enough knowledge so please don't blame ;)

U need to download Flan's mod and inside it download "Flans Simple Parts Pack" and "Alcara v1"

*for line detection it uses EmguCV

-*sorry for that*- in the code change the directory string

-After starting program put your minecraft screen to upper left corner with size of 960x540

-press Start button

-If you want to train it more than just ride between lines and after you are done press 'J'

-If you want to see it ride itself just press Run (Start buttom must be pressed before) and wait a second (or minute because it's not saving trained model and retraining it every time)

-ENJOY 

-Added Stop Button, it ends application like when you exit from it but I it didn't stop all processes before so it's nice ;)

This is just repost of my old project because at the time I didn't know how to use git so I put in README link to zip of that project
